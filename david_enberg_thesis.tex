%% WHAT is PDF/A
%%
%% PDF/A is the ISO-standardized version of the pdf. The standard's goal is to
%% ensure that he file is reproducable even after a long time. PDF/A differs
%% from pdf in that it allows only those pdf features that support long-term
%% archiving of a file. For example, PDF/A requires that all used fonts are
%% embedded in the file, whereas a normal pdf can contain only a link to the
%% fonts in the system of the reader of the file. PDF/A also requires, among
%% other things, data on colour definition and the encryption used.
%% Currently three PDF/A standards exist:
%% PDF/A-1: based on PDF 1.4, standard ISO19005-1, published in 2005.
%%          Includes all the requirements essential for long-term archiving.
%% PDF/A-2: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-2, published in 2011.
%%          In addition to the above, it supports embedding of OpenType fonts,
%%          transparency in the colour definition and digital signatures.
%% PDF/A-3: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-3, published in 2012.
%%          Differs from the above only in that it allows embedding of files in
%%          any format (e.g., xml, csv, cad, spreadsheet or wordprocessing
%%          formats) into the pdf file.
%% PDF/A-4: based on PDF 2.0, standard ISO19005-4, published in November 2020.
%%
%% PDF/A-1 files are not necessarily PDF/A-2 -compatible and PDF/A-2 are not
%% necessarily PDF/A-1 -compatible.
%% Standards PDF/A-1, PDF/A-2 and PDF/A-3 have two levels:
%% b: (basic) requires that the visual appearance of the document is reliably
%%    reproduceable.
%% a (accessible) in addition to the b-level requirements, specifies how
%%   accessible the pdf file is to assistive software, say, for the physically
%%   impaired.
%% The PDF/A-4 standard does not have additional levels like in the earlier
%% standards.
%% For more details on PDF/A, see, e.g., 
%% https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000318.shtml or
%% https://www.pdfa.org/resource/iso-19005-pdfa/
%%
%%
%% WHICH PDF/A standard should my thesis conform to?
%%
%% Either to the PDF/A-2b or the PDF/A-1b standard. If all the figures and
%% graphs used in thesis work do not require transparency features, use either
%% PDF/A-1b or PFDF/A-2b. If you have figures with transparency
%% characteristics, use the PDF/A-2b standard. However, drawing applications
%% often use the transparency parameter, setting it to zero, to specify opacity
%% and get the basic 2-D visualisation. As a result, validation of PDF/A-1b
%% will fail. Use PDF/A-2b if PDF/A-1b validation fails.
%% Do not use the PDF/A-3b standard for your thesis.
%% The font to be used are specified in this templatenand they should not be
%% changed. In addition to not adhering to Aalto's visual guidelines, you may
%% have difficulties in producing a PDF/A-compliant PDF.
%%
%%
%% Validate your PDF/A file at https://www.pdf-online.com/osa/validate.aspx
%%
%%
%% WHAT graphics format can I use to produce my PDF/A compliant file?
%%
%% When using pdflatex to compile your work, favour the use of pdf, but you can
%% use the jpg or png format especially for photographs. You will have PDF/A 
%% compliance problems with figures in pdf if the fonts are not embedded in the
%% pdf file.
%% If you choose to use latex to compile your work, the only acceptable file
%% format for your figure is eps. DO NOT use the ps format for your figures.
%%
%% USE one of the following three \documentclass set-ups:
%% * the first when using pdflatex to directly typeset your document in the
%%   chosen pdf/a format for online publishing (centred page layout),
%% * the second for one-sided printing your thesis with the layout (wide left 
%%   margin), or
%% * the third for two-sided printing.

%% The abstract text. This text in one paragraph is included in the metadata of
%% the pdf file as well as the abstract page. To have paragraphs in your
%% abstract rewrite it in the abstarct environment as described below.

%% You can prevent LaTeX from writing into the xmpdata file (it contains all the 
%% metadata to be written into the pdf file) by setting the writexmpdata switch
%% to 'false'. This allows you to write the metadata in the correct format
%% directly into the file thesistemplate.xmpdata.

%% Typeset the copyright text.
%% If you wish, you may leave out the copyright text from the human-readable
%% page of the pdf file. This may seem like a attractive idea for the printed
%% document especially if "Copyright (c) yyyy Eddie Engineer" is the only text
%% on the page. However, the recommendation is to print this copyright text.

%% Note that when writing your thesis in English, place the English abstract
%% first followed by the possible Finnish or Swedish abstract.

%% Abstract text
%% All the details (name, title, etc.) on the abstract page appear as specified
%% above. Add your abstarct text with paragraphs here to have paragraphs in the
%% visible abstract page. Nonetheless, write the abstarct text without
%% paragraphs in the macro \thesismacro so that it is added to the metadata as
%% well.
%%
\begin{abstractpage}[english]
\end{abstractpage}

%% The text in the \thesisabstract macro is stored in the macro \abstractext, so
%% you can use the text metadata abstract directly as follows:
%%
%\begin{abstractpage}[english]
%	\abstracttext{}
%\end{abstractpage}


%% Force new page so that the Swedish abstract starts from a new page
\newpage

%% Swedish abstract. Delete it if you don't need it.

%% Respecify those fields that differ from the earlier specification or simply
%% respecify all fields.
