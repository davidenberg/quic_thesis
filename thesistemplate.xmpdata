\Subject {The abstract is a short description of the essential contents of the thesis usually in one paragraph: what was studied and how and what were the main findings. For a Finnish thesis, the abstract should be written in both Finnish and English; for a Swedish thesis, in Swedish and English. The abstracts for English theses written by Finnish or Swedish speakers should be written in English and either in Finnish or in Swedish, depending on the studentâ€™s language of basic education. Students educated in languages other than Finnish or Swedish write the abstract only in English. Students may include a second or third abstract in their native language, if they wish. The abstract text of this thesis is written on the readable abstract page as well as into the pdf file's metadata via the thesisabstract macro (see the comment in the TeX file). Write here the text that goes into the metadata. The metadata cannot contain special characters, linebreak or paragraph break characters, so these must not be used here. If your abstract does not contain special characters and it does not require paragraphs, you may take advantage of the abstracttext macro (see the comment in the TeX file below). Otherwise, the metadata abstract text must be identical to the text on the abstract page. }
